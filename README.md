# Sequence Analysis

# Abstract
This project aims at the principles of analysing (DNA-) sequence data, which are vastly and freely available on scientific bioinformatics databases (check out my website www.bio-century.net for further info). "Part 1" is a collection of Python-based example codes focussing on sequence analysis on a very basic level. More parts are to come soon...<br>
Goals and example code is presented in a Jupyter-Notebook-(.ipynb-)fileformat. Jupyter-NB or equivalent extensions in the IDE of your choice is thus required to modify it.

## <a id='GettingStarted'></a> Getting Started
All you need is a running jupyter notebook distribution of some sort as well as python fulfilling the requirements listed in section [ Requirements](#-requirements). Strongly recommended is vs code with it's .ipynb-extension 


### <a id='InspirationsAndToDos'></a> Inspirations & ToDo's
Here is room for your inspiration, which is very much appreciated! Please be patient as concerns implementationof your ideas, since the resources (time and personnel) are limited.
- [ ] Progress in groundwork towards NGS-sequencing
- [ ] Next Idea 1
- [ ] Next Idea 2
- [ ] ...
